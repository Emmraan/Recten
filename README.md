# Welcome to Recten - My First React App!

Hello everyone! This is my first React app, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stronvn/Recten.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd Recten


3.  Install dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install


## Running the App
## Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the app using the following command:
    npm start


This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
